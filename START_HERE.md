   - Anthropic: https://console.anthropic.com
   - AssemblyAI: https://www.assemblyai.com (free tier)
   - Groq: https://groq.com (free tier)

2. **Add to .env**:
```bash
cp apps/backend/.env.example apps/backend/.env
# Edit the file with your keys
```

USE_REAL_ADAPTERS=true
```

4. **Run**:
```bash
pnpm dev

Still no Docker! All APIs are cloud-based.
