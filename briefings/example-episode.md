# Episode Briefing: The Future of Small Language Models

## Overview
This episode explores the debate between small, efficient language models and their larger counterparts. We'll examine whether smaller models can truly compete in real-world applications and what trade-offs developers face.

## Key Discussion Points

### Efficiency Claims
- Small models (1-7B parameters) vs large models (70B+)
- Energy consumption and carbon footprint
- Inference speed and latency comparisons
- Cost per API call

### Privacy & Local Deployment
- Running models on-device
- Data privacy implications
- Edge computing scenarios
- Offline capabilities

### Real-World Performance
- Task-specific benchmarks
- General reasoning capabilities
- When do you actually need a larger model?
- Success stories and limitations

## Debate Angle

**Claude's Position:** Defend the nuanced view that model size should match the task, and that the industry's obsession with "bigger is better" has created blind spots.

**Guest's Position:** Should argue either:
- Small models are underrated and can handle 80% of use cases
- OR large models are necessary for truly intelligent behavior

## Production Notes
- Target a 20-minute conversation
- Allow natural interruptions and tangents
- Use concrete examples and real benchmarks
- Encourage thinking mode for complex comparisons
