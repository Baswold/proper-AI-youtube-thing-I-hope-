IMPORTANT: CI/CD Workflow Requires Manual Setup
================================================

A complete GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline has been created at:
  .github/workflows/ci.yml

However, it could not be automatically pushed due to GitHub App
permissions restrictions.

TO ADD THE WORKFLOW TO YOUR REPOSITORY:

Option 1 - Copy locally and push manually:
  1. The ci.yml file is available in your local .github/workflows/ directory
  2. You can commit it manually when ready:
     git add .github/workflows/ci.yml
     git commit -m "ci: Add automated CI/CD pipeline"
     git push

Option 2 - Create directly on GitHub:
  1. Go to your repository on GitHub
  2. Navigate to the "Actions" tab
  3. Click "New workflow" or "set up a workflow yourself"
  4. Copy the contents from your local .github/workflows/ci.yml
  5. Commit directly on GitHub

WHAT THE WORKFLOW PROVIDES:

✅ Automated testing on every push
✅ TypeScript type checking and linting
✅ Backend tests with PostgreSQL and Redis
✅ Frontend tests
✅ Docker image builds with caching
✅ Security vulnerability scanning
✅ Code coverage reporting
✅ Automated deployment to production

The workflow runs automatically on:
- Push to main, develop, or claude/* branches
- Pull requests to main or develop
- Manual workflow dispatch

For more details, see .github/README.md

Note: The workflow file remains in your local repository and can be
added to version control whenever you're ready.
